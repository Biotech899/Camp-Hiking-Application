# Badminton Trainer
This will be the github repository where the application files for the development of the badminton trainer will happen. WIll update Later

We will likely use the Nano 33 Ble Sense microcontroller for the use of an easy to use IMU and tensorflow lte acess.

For now we will train our model using the Tiny Motion Trainer:
